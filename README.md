# Meditiation Timer by Brian Nicholls

After spending a considerable amount of time looking for a simple app to regulate my breathing, I couldn't find one that I liked.
So, I made one. It's a simple app that produces a (hopefully) pleasing sound so that you can regulate your breathing easily.
It's lightweight and accessible on pretty much any device, as it's just vanilla JavaScript. Enjoy!
